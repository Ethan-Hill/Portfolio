        I have played 4 years at my local rugby club, Rockcliff RFC, as an
        outside flanker where I recently endured a torn ACL and had to have
        surgery on December 10th 2020. I also enjoy doing crossfit to keep the
        endurance high while also cycling when I get the time.

        This one isn't much of a hobby but I love walking my dog Oma. She's a
        Staffordshire Bull Terrier mixed with a Australian Kelpie.
