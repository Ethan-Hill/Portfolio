        Iâ€™m Ethan. I'm a passionate Junior Software Developer. I'm currently 18
        and I started my programming journey in 2017 when I was introduced to
        HTML. Since then I have been working on getting my career started in
        Software Engineering or Web Development.

        I have spent a lot of my spare time creating projects to help myself
        learn new aspects of different programming languages and design
        methodologies. I've been studying software engineering at college since
        2019 and it has been brilliant. I've also been doing self-taught web
        development during this time and I have become familiar with frameworks
        like React and Vue.
